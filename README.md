# Code Agent Rules

This repository is dedicated to defining and managing configuration rules and instructions for various AI-powered coding assistants. The goal is to ensure consistent, high-quality code generation and interaction when using these agents within our projects.

## Purpose

As AI coding assistants become more integrated into development workflows, it's crucial to provide them with clear guidelines and project-specific context. This repository serves as a centralized location for these "rulesets."

## Current Focus

Currently, this repository contains instructions specifically for **GitHub Copilot**.

-   **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**: This file provides detailed directives for GitHub Copilot to follow when generating code within projects that adopt these rules. It covers general coding principles, project-specific conventions (meant to be customized per project), and best practices for interacting with Copilot.

## Future Plans

We plan to expand this repository to include rules and instructions for other coding agents as they become relevant to our development practices. This will allow for a unified approach to managing AI-assisted development across different tools.

## Key Files

-   `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Instructions and guidelines for GitHub Copilot.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for improving the existing rules or want to contribute rules for other coding agents, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
